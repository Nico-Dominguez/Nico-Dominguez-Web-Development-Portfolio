          <h1>A little bit about me!</h1>
          <p>
            I've always been undecided of what I want to do in life. This
            indecision has plagued me even through college. I was always a go
            with the flow type of guy. When I got my first job I was excited!
            Why? because I finally got a job doing what I learned at college?
            Maybe... Because I had a stable income? Most Likely.
          </p>
          <p>
            By year three, I was yearning for something new. I had come to a
            conclusion, I did not like what I was doing... I have always had a
            creative mind but my job was limiting that. This is when I
            discovered computer programming. This new realm, albeit a bit more
            difficult intrigued me and I wanted to learn more. I took a simple
            html, css course and I fell in love.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now a self-taught frontend developer with an itch to learn
            more. I'm currently looking for frontend devloper roles and also
            freelance. Hopefully we can connect!

                I've been working about for about three years. I love to stay
                active in the gym even though I always feel the pain the next
                morning :p

                I've been on many hiking trails around my city and in other

                My mom is the culprit for this hobby. I always thought it was a
                trendy sport. Once I actually started playing however, the
                competitive spirit kicked in and now I play at least once a
                week!
